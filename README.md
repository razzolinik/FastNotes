# Web-Based Note-Taking Application "FastNotes" by Razzolini Khiara.

This project is a simple but functional **web-based note-taking application**, developed from scratch for a technical interview challenge with the current knowledge that I have. It supports user login, creation of styled notes, archiving, search functionality, and a modern UI experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Configuration

- You must have **MySQL** installed and running.
- Create a database named (for example):  
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE notesdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

### 2. MySQL JDBC Driver
Install the MySQL JDBC driver (Connector/J):

Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

Add the .jar to your project libraries.

Or configure it in GlassFish:
Admin Console > Resources > JDBC > JDBC Drivers

### 3. GlassFish Deployment
Deploy the project on GlassFish Server (v5+).

Add a JDBC resource (e.g. jdbc/notes) matching the one defined in your persistence.xml (if applicable).

### 4. Login
üîê User-Specific Data
Each user has access only to their own notes.

Notes are linked to users via a foreign key (user_id) in the database.

Session management ensures data isolation.
- USER: kikiwi
- PASSWORD: ensolvers
- The project could handle more users if an "user" table is created on the DB. Still, even if you logout, the notes remain there.
